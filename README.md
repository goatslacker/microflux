# ÂµFlux

### Update

[I merged a lot of the ideas here into Alt](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/pull/279).

--

This is a really small (currently experimental) flux implementation taking ideas from:

* Alt
* Nuclear
* RxJS
* React-future

## Warning

This is pretty early software.
There are currently no tests.
There is no documentation.
Read the code or check out the examples.
